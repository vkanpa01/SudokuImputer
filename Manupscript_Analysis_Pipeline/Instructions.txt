Description of analysis pipeline:

datasets/
    0_experimental_data_generator.ipynb: reads in the specified, hard-coded experimental datasets (stored in datasets directory), and synthetically induces missingness via MCAR, MAR, or MNAR probability distributions at the specified missingness proportion range. Stores experimental datasets in datasets/experimental_data/numerical.

1_numerical_imputation_pipeliny.py: Imputes datasets stored in datasets/experimental_data/numerical via Mean, Median, kNN, MICE, SoftImpute, and Matrix Factorization. Outputs [dataset]_imputed.csv and [dataset]_runtime.txt files to datasets/imputed_data/numerical.

2_execute_sudoku.py: reads experimental dataset from datasets/experimental_data/numerical/[DATASET]/[MISSINGNESS_TYPE]/[FILE] and outputs imputed dataset in outputs/[missingness_type_lower]/[dataset_lower]/. Also saves runtime as .txt and log file of imputation metadata. Can be called from terminal via "python 2_execute_sudoku.py [EXP_FILE_PATH]" Flags can be added as desired (i.e "--edge-threshold 0.1" or "--max-rounds 5").

sudoku_hyperparameters.py: Performs a grid search over a predefined hyperparameter space and outputs files in analysis/supp_tables. Called via "python sudoku_hyperparameters.py [EXP_FILE_PATH]."

analysis/ 
    3_benchmark_analysis.ipynb: reads in all sudoku-imputed files, benchmark method-imputed files, and ground truth dataset files (stored at datasets/experimental_data/numerical/{dataset}/[FILE]) from their directories. Computes RMSE, MAE, Pearson correlation, and R2 between imputed values and ground truth values ONLY where values are synthetically missing in the experimental data. The metrics per column are averaged together to create a dataset-wise average score. Script runs for all missingness proportions of one set of experimental datasets at a time (i.e only for MCAR-EEG). Outputs a summary table for mean and standard error to analysis/results_tables/benchmarking_results.

    4_runtime_analysis.ipynb: Computes tables for runtime of each benchmark imputation method (and SudokuImputer) across all missingness proportions for a given set of experimental datasets (i.e only for MCAR-EEG). Outputs a summary table to analysis/supp_tables/s2_mean_runtime and to analysis/results_tables/runtime/.

    5_figure_visualization.ipynb: Reads the mean and SE summary tables generated by 3_benchmark_analysis (stored in results_tables/benchmarking_results/{dataset}/{missingness}/[FILE]). Generates line plots (with and without error bars) and heatmaps for each missingness proportion of a set of experimental datasets (i.e all proportions for MCAR-EEG), corresponding to Kanpa et al. Figures 5A and 5B. Saves figures as .png and .svg files in results_figures/{dataset}/{missingness}/[FILES].

    6_hyperparameter_analysis.ipynb: Reads in the model hyperparameters and associated performance (from hyperparameter_tables/{missingness}/FILES) and cleans and concatenates into a large grid-search performance dataframe. Dataframe should be saved to hyperparameter_tables directory.

    7_hyperparameter_visualizer.ipynb: Reads in the concatenated hyperparameter performance tables assembled in 6_hyperparameter_analysis to generate Kanpa et al. Figures 2 and 3.

    8_log_analysis.ipynb: An analysis of experimental benchmarking log files to generate line plots between missingness proportion and number of models fit per dataset, corresponding to Kanpa et al. Figure 4.

    supp_tables/
        supp_table_assembly.ipynb: Reads in all the set-of-datasets (i.e EEG-MCAR) performance and runtime summaries to create extended supplementary tables for Kanpa et al., Supplementary tables 1 and 2.

    results_tables/
        runtime/
            runtime_figure.ipynb: Reads in all runtimes stored in runtime/ to generate Figure 9 from Kanpa et al, comparing average runtimes of each model by dataset size. 

        all_results/
            mega_tables: Computes the average rank of each benchmark method compared to other methods for each experimental dataset. Generates Figures 6, 7, and 8 from Kanpa et al.
